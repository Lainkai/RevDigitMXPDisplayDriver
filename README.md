# RevDigitMXPDisplayDriver
A Driver for the Rev Robotics Digit MXP Display, found at: http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1113/

# Documentation
The link to the docs can be found [here](https://lainkai.github.io/RevDigitMXPDisplayDriver/).

# How to use
This has dependencies. If you want to have a good time, I suggest you use gradle.

The main controlling class is `RevDigitDisplay`. It is the only display I have made drivers for.
Use the `getInstance()` method, becuase its constructor is private. It's called a singleton. All info
can be found in the documentation.
